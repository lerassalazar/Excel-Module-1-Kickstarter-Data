# Excel-Module-1-Kickstarter-Data
Analyzing kickstarter data on excel
Overview of Project
The purpose of this analysis was to sort through data to help Louise understand the results of her fundraising efforts for her play Fever.

Purpose
The purpose of this challenge was to understand how to better use excel to sift through and analyze data. It helped us extract information that isn't immediately obvious and taught us how to use different formulas to reach that goal. We also learned how to analyze and sift through it using pivot charts.

Analysis and Challenges
I don't think I performed my best this week, as I had been sick with covid and had to miss one of our classes.  I went back into the lesson materials and looked for what I needed to find. I also used the quick tips and watched videos on youtube.

Results
What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date? I can conclude that 2015 was a peak year for both failed and successful events, and that interest in these events died down by 2017. Plays also do well in June/July. 

What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals? They either failed or did well, but no plays were canceled. The less funding they received, the more likely they were successful.

What are some limitations of this dataset? Some of the limitations of the dataset include the experience of the people submitting and the size of the project in terms of costliness/crew. Also the interest by country. 

What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create? It would have been interesting to create charts that mapped out success by country, ie. theater is more popular in the UK than perhaps it is in the USA.
